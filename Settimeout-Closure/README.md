# Problem - Fix the Probelm by using the SetTimeout and Closure Concept
 * We need to print the value of "i" (the loop iterator) in each loop iteration/cycle after specific time which is started from (1000 milisec/1 Sec) incremented to double after each iteration
<pre>
//Output Required

1 //after 1 sec
2 //after 2 sec
3 //after 3 sec
4 //after 4 sec
5 //after 5 sec
6 //after 6 sec
7 //after 7 sec
8 //after 8 sec
9 //after 9 sec
10 //after 10 sec
</pre>
 * The porblem is currently we are getting the name iteration number in a repetive manner but we need the number of each iteration printed on console after a set time

//Output Currently Getting
