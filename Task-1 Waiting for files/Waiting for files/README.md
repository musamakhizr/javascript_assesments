# Task: Waiting for Files

### Create a function to load an external resource (like a script or a file), you cannot use the content before it is fully loaded.

### Use a callback & XMLHttpRequest


* This example loads an HTML file (blog.html), and displays the HTML file in a web page, after the file is fully loaded using javascript.

* Also fix other bugs
